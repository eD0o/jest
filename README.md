# 2 - Basics

## 2.0 - Why we need tests ?

Peace of mind as a dev/tester:
- Catch bugs early.
- Save time with debugging.
- Unit tests impose high quality code, if an unit test is difficult to test, the code quality should be improved.
- Prevent endless manual tests.

### 2.0.1 - What are software tests ?

- Code that runs other code and `makes assertions and checks`.`
- Requirements and/or specifications that will be checked.
