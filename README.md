# 4 - Test Driven Development with Jest

## 4.1 - TDD Introduction

1. **Test First Development**:

   - The primary principle of TDD is to `write tests before writing the actual implementation` code.
   - This ensures that you `define clear requirements and expectations` for your code from the outset.

2. **The TDD Cycle**:

   - The TDD process follows a simple, repetitive cycle often summarized as **Red-Green-Refactor**:
     1. **Red**: `Write a test for a new functionality. Initially, this test will fail` because the functionality is not yet implemented.
     2. **Green**: `Write the minimum amount of code necessary` to make the test pass.
     3. **Refactor**: `Clean up the code while ensuring that all tests still pass`. Refactoring can involve improving code structure, optimizing performance, or making the code more readable.

3. **Benefits of TDD**:

   - **Improved Design**: Writing tests first helps in defining clear and concise requirements, leading to a better-designed system.
   - **Less Debugging**: Since tests are written first, many bugs are caught early in the development process.
   - **Easier Maintenance**: With a comprehensive test suite, making changes to the code becomes less risky because you can quickly verify that existing functionality is not broken.

4. **Gradual Test Development**:

   - For larger projects, `achieving a basic working state first and then gradually writing tests helps in managing complexity`.
   - This approach allows for incremental improvements and ensures that the project remains manageable and testable at each stage.

- This image effectively illustrates the TDD cycle:
  1. **Tests Fail**: Initially, tests are written without any implementation, so they fail.
  2. **Implement Code**: Code is written to pass the tests.
  3. **Add Logic and Tests**: After the initial implementation, additional logic and corresponding tests are added.

By following this cycle, TDD helps in developing reliable, maintainable, and well-tested software.
